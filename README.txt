1. Overview
   --------
   Universal Password Manager (UPM) allows you to store usernames, passwords, URLs,
   and generic notes in an encrypted database protected by one master password.

   There are several open source password managers available so what makes UPM 
   different? It's three strongest features are...

    * it's simplicity - it provides a small number of very strong features with no
      clutter.

    * cross platform - UPM runs on Android, Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

    * database syncing - This feature allows your to keep you database in sync
      across several PCs/devices using either Dropbox or a HTTP location.

2. Features
   --------
   .Small, fast and lean
   .Uses AES for database encryption
   .Database sync across multiple PCs/devices
   .Written in Java/SWING
   .Android, Windows and Mac OS X native feeling versions available
   .Fast account searching
   .Streamlined for those who are more comfortable using the keyboard only

3. Support
   -------
   A full set of instructions is available at,
   http://upm.sourceforge.net/upm_swing_userguide.html.

   A support forum is available at,
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/upm/support.

4. Internationalization
   --------------------
   UPM supports multiple languages. For each language a separate resource bundle
   file is included. UPM includes resource bundles for
     * English
     * Czech
     * German
     * Italian
     * Spanish
     * French
     * Polish
   I'd really appreciate help from anyone willing to provide translations for
   UPM's messages. You can find the English resource bundle (upm.properties) in
   the upm.jar file that ships with UPM (Winzip, 7-Zip, or some other zip tool
   can be used to uncompress the JAR file).
